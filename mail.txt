Subject: Meeting Request: Moving to Production for reCAPTCHA Implementation in MyBenefits Application

Hi Suneel,

Scheduling this meet to discuss the progress of implementing reCAPTCHA in our MyBenefits application and the next steps for moving it to production.

Based on recent testing results, we observed that the reCAPTCHA score remained constant in the data power layer when we mimicked a bot to evaluate it. This raised concerns about the accuracy of the score and its effectiveness in detecting bots.

During our investigation, we discovered that the ER team has not conducted a similar test during their implementation of reCAPTCHA. However, they have been logging the score for successful transactions on a daily basis and have noticed variations in the score over time.
